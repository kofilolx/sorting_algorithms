# The ALX Project Sorting algorithms & Big O

### The ALX Project focuses on sorting algorithms and their computational complexity represented by the Big O notation:

Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a specified order, crucial for managing data effectively in computer science and programming. Big O notation quantifies the upper limit of an algorithm's time complexity, indicating how its performance scales with input size.

Efficiency, often gauged through Big O notation, is a critical factor in selecting a sorting algorithm. Despite various algorithms with distinct pros and cons, their primary objective remains consistent: sorting data efficiently. Sorting algorithms play pivotal roles in tasks such as dataset management, value comparison, and data analysis.
